# GD Background Changer
 re-routes the background image from the first online scene to a custom background. The asset called is `GJ_altbg_001.png` by default

 ## Requirements

 - Geometry Dash

 - custom background asset

 - python 3.9

 ## How Does It Work?

 The address which gets called is changed to a new custom asset and as a result it is possible to seperate the background
